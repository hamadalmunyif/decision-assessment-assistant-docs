# DAA Pack Developer Guide

**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Decision Assessment Assistant (DAA) Pack Developer Guide! This document provides everything you need to know to build, test, and submit your own Decision Packs to the DAA ecosystem.

Packs are the core of the DAA platform. They are self-contained modules that define a specific decision-making model. By creating a Pack, you can share your expertise with the community and earn revenue based on its usage.

---

## 2. The "Core + Packs" Architecture

The DAA platform uses a **"Core + Packs"** architecture:

- **The Core:** A proprietary, closed-source engine that handles the complex logic of evaluation, risk analysis, and recommendation generation. The Core is maintained by the DAA team and cannot be modified.
- **Packs:** Open-source modules that you, the developer, create. A Pack provides the domain-specific knowledge required to assess a particular type of decision (e.g., "Should I buy a car?" or "Which tech stack should I choose?").

This architecture allows for a clear separation of concerns: the DAA team focuses on the core platform, while the community focuses on building a rich library of high-quality Decision Packs.

## 3. The 80/20 Revenue Sharing Model

We believe in rewarding our community for their contributions. That's why we offer a generous **80/20 revenue sharing model**:

- **80% to You:** As a Pack creator, you will receive 80% of the revenue generated by your Pack.
- **20% to the Platform:** The remaining 20% goes to the DAA platform to cover the costs of hosting, maintenance, and further development of the Core engine.

## 4. Anatomy of a Pack

A Pack is a simple directory containing three core YAML files. This structure is strictly enforced by our validation system.

```
my-awesome-pack/
├── pack.yaml              # Metadata for the Pack
├── criteria.yaml          # The heart of your Pack: the decision criteria
└── templates.yaml         # Recommendation templates
```

### 4.1. `pack.yaml`

This file contains the metadata for your Pack.

**Fields:**
- `id`: A unique, lowercase, hyphenated identifier.
- `name`: The human-readable name of the Pack.
- `version`: The version of your Pack (must follow Semantic Versioning).
- `author`: Your name and email.
- `description`: A brief, one-sentence description.
- `tags`: A list of relevant keywords.

**Example:**
```yaml
id: should-i-buy-a-car
name: "Should I Buy a Car? Pack"
version: 1.0.0
author: "Your Name <you@example.com>"
description: "A simple pack to help you decide if you should buy a car."
tags: ["finance", "lifestyle", "transportation"]
```

### 4.2. `criteria.yaml`

This is the most important file in your Pack. It defines the criteria that will be used to evaluate the decision.

**Fields for each criterion:**
- `name`: The name of the criterion.
- `description`: A clear explanation of what the criterion measures.
- `category`: The category of the criterion (e.g., `Financial`, `Personal`).
- `default_weight`: The importance of this criterion (from 0.0 to 1.0). **The sum of all weights must equal 1.0.**

**Example:**
```yaml
- name: "Financial Cost"
  description: "The total cost of owning a car, including purchase price, insurance, fuel, and maintenance."
  category: "Financial"
  default_weight: 0.4
- name: "Convenience"
  description: "How much convenience a car would add to your life."
  category: "Lifestyle"
  default_weight: 0.3
- name: "Alternatives"
  description: "The availability and quality of alternative transportation options."
  category: "Lifestyle"
  default_weight: 0.2
- name: "Environmental Impact"
  description: "The environmental footprint of owning a car."
  category: "Environmental"
  default_weight: 0.1
```

### 4.3. `templates.yaml`

This file contains the templates for the recommendations that will be shown to the user.

**Fields:**
- `recommendation`: A list of three recommendation templates.
  - `type`: Must be one of `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral`.
  - `template`: The text of the recommendation.

**Example:**
```yaml
recommendation:
  - type: "positive"
    template: "Based on your inputs, buying a car appears to be a good decision for you."
  - type: "negative"
    template: "Based on your inputs, buying a car might not be the best decision for you right now."
  - type: "neutral"
    template: "The decision to buy a car is not clear-cut in your case. Further evaluation is recommended."
```

## 5. The Development Workflow

### Step 1: Create Your Pack Directory

Start by creating a new directory for your Pack and the three core YAML files.

```bash
mkdir my-new-pack
cd my-new-pack
touch pack.yaml criteria.yaml templates.yaml
```

### Step 2: Define Your Metadata, Criteria, and Templates

Fill in the content of your three YAML files according to the specifications in this guide and the `SCHEMA_SPECIFICATION.md`.

### Step 3: Validate Your Pack

Before submitting your Pack, you **must** validate it using our official validation script. This script checks for schema compliance, file existence, and other potential issues.

```bash
# From the root of the daa-docs-public repository
python3 scripts/validate_pack.py /path/to/your/my-new-pack
```

If the validation is successful, you will see a confirmation message. If it fails, the script will provide detailed error messages to help you fix the issues.

### Step 4: Submit Your Pack

Once your Pack passes validation, you can submit it for review. The submission process is handled through a pull request to the `decision-assessment-assistant-docs` repository.

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your Pack.
3.  Add your Pack to the `examples/` directory.
4.  Open a pull request.

Our team will review your Pack for quality, usefulness, and compliance with our methodology. If approved, it will be added to the official DAA Marketplace.

## 6. Best Practices

- **Start with an Example:** The easiest way to get started is to copy one of the existing examples and modify it.
- **Be Scientific:** Your criteria should be based on research and a clear, defensible methodology.
- **Write Clear Descriptions:** The `description` fields are crucial for helping users understand your Pack.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Use the validation script to catch errors early.
- **Keep it Simple:** A good Pack is often a simple one. Focus on the most important criteria for a given decision.
