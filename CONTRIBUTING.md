If you can't find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/hamadalmunyif/decision-assessment-assistant-docs/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for an enhancement, we'd love to hear it! Please [open an issue](https://github.com/hamadalmunyif/decision-assessment-assistant-docs/issues/new) and describe your suggestion in detail. The more information you can provide, the better.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

- [Good first issues](https://github.com/hamadalmunyif/decision-assessment-assistant-docs/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/hamadalmunyif/decision-assessment-assistant-docs/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue` issues.
